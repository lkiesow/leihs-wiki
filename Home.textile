Please head to "http://code.zhdk.ch/projects/leihs":http://code.zhdk.ch/projects/leihs to find the "official development wiki":http://code.zhdk.ch/projects/leihs for leihs.

The version on GitHub is based on revision 1690 out of Subversion: http://code.zhdk.ch/svn/leihs/trunk. We will be maintaining a branch on GitHub while we experiment with a new feature. Once that feature is stable, it is merged into master on GitHub. From that moment on, GitHub will become the authoritative source repository for leihs.

The wiki at GitHub is not maintained.

Bugs and issues are also tracked at the ZHdK Trac, not at GitHub.
