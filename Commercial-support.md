## Requirements for offering support

You should have the following experience or familiarity with the following software if you want to set up and support a leihs instance for someone:

 * Debian GNU/Linux because that's the base operating system.
 * Ruby on Rails application hosting.
   * [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/) can help with this, it makes it easier to host Ruby on Rails applications using Apache or Nginx.
 * MariaDB or MySQL administration.

Depending on what the customer wants to connect to leihs, the following experience might be useful:

 * LDAP or Active Directory
 * Shibboleth

Please note that if you use the [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) automation system, setup is almost completely automated. You can find a deployment playbook for leihs [in their own repository](https://github.com/leihs/ansible-leihs-setup).
