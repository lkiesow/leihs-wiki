## leihs -- the equipment booking and inventory management system

leihs is a system with which universities or other organizations can **manage and book their equipment**. People can place reservations/bookings on items and then pick them up at e.g. a reservation desk. The system keeps track of who has which items and gives equipment managers time to worry about other things.


## Documentation

* **Installation and administration:** To install leihs, you need a GNU/Linux server capable of running Ruby and Ruby on Rails. The installation itself is covered in the [[leihs-Admin-Guide]].

* **Production servers:** The guide above shows only a simple setup. If you want a production-class server using automated deployment, Phusion Passenger, Apache, Node.js etc., you can find a long and detailed example of how to set up something like that in the [[leihs-Production-Server-Guide]].

* **Development:** You can extend and adapt leihs to your needs. Some specific topics (such as how to help us translate leihs) are covered in the [[leihs-Developer-Guide]].

* **User guide:** There is no user guide for leihs yet. Do you want to write one? Feel free to start a new page on this wiki.

## Versioning

We subscribe to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) approach, and our versions are handled as follows:

`Major.Minor.Patch.pre-release`

So for example:

`1.0.5-alpha1`

* Major: Backwards-incompatible changes were added. See the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) document for more details.
* Minor: Backwards-compatible changes to the API were made, functionality is marked as deprecated or some new functionality was added.
* Patch: Bugfixes were made, but they are backwards-compatible.
* Pre-release: We only use these when we target a new major version, e.g. 4.0.0-alpha2 is definitely unstable and incomplete code, aiming for a release of version 4.0.0, which is incompatible with version 3.0.0.
