# leihs -- the equipment booking and inventory management system

leihs is a system with which universities or other organizations can **manage and book their equipment**. People can place reservations/bookings on items and then pick them up at e.g. a reservation desk. The system keeps track of who has which items and gives equipment managers time to worry about other things.

### Live demo

You can try out a live installation of leihs at http://demo.leihs.zhdk.ch. If the demo happens to be down, please contact Ramon (see [[DevPeople]] page).
