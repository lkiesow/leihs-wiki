A typical production deployment process for leihs could look like the following. This is modeled after the process that is actually in use at the ZÃ¼rich University of the Arts (ZHdK).

Server landscape:

* rails.zhdk.ch with the following:
  * Apache 2
  * Phusion Passenger
  * RVM
  * Ruby 1.9.3-p448 installed through RVM

* db.zhdk.ch with the following:
  * MariaDB

## Steps to take to deploy a new version of leihs at the ZHdK

With Capistrano installed on your workstation, enter the leihs source code directory and do:

    # cap production deploy

If you have permission as user `leihs@rails.zhdk.ch`, Capistrano will magically deploy a version of leihs to rails.zhdk.ch. The following explains exactly what happens here and in which steps.
