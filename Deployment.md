A typical production deployment process for leihs could look like the following. This is modeled after the process that is actually in use at the ZÃ¼rich University of the Arts (ZHdK).

Server landscape, the servers you're deploying to:

* rails.zhdk.ch with the following:
  * Apache
  * Phusion Passenger
  * RVM
  * Ruby 1.9.3-p448 installed through RVM

* db.zhdk.ch with the following:
  * MariaDB


Client requirements:

You need to have at least Ruby 1.9.3 and the following gems on the workstation that you will be deploying from:

* capistrano
* capistrano-ext
* rvm-capistrano


## Steps to take to deploy a new version of leihs at the ZHdK

With Capistrano installed on your workstation, enter the leihs source code directory and do:

    # cap production deploy

If you have permission to log in as user `leihs@rails.zhdk.ch`, Capistrano will magically deploy a version of leihs to rails.zhdk.ch. Where does Capistrano get those usernames and server names from? How does it know what to do? The following explains exactly what happens here and in which steps.


## Rough overview of the deployment steps

When we run Capistrano, it does the following:

* Connects to the target server by SSH.
* Switches to the correct Ruby version using RVM.
* Grabs the freshest source code.
* Runs bundler to install RubyGems.
* Migrates the database to the latest version.
* Precompiles all assets.
* Touches the `/tmp/restart.txt` file to signal Apache/Passenger to restart the application.

There are some details in each of these steps. They are explained below.

## Explanation of the files in config/deploy

Most of the Capistrano magic happens in the files in config/deploy. There are several of these:

### config/deploy/deploy.rb

This file is absolutely empty. This is a remnant of the capistrano-ext extensions for multi-stage deployments. You can put some toplevel configuration in here, but we don't really need that. All serious configuration is done inside the multistage config files that we'll explain next.


### config/deploy/production.rb

The production configuration file. Production here refers to the production server, as in not the staging server. Since this guide is about deploying to production, we'll look at this first.

The first section is about RVM and how it's installed on the server. Since the server uses Phusion Passenger, the only supported Ruby version manager is RVM (in case you were wondering why this isn't using rbenv, chruby or one of the others). The options set which version of Ruby to use on the target server, and where RVM is installed. RVM is installed system-wide by the root user, which by default puts it in `/usr/local/rvm`:

```ruby
require "rvm/capistrano"
set :rvm_type, :system
set :rvm_ruby_string, '1.9.3'
set :rvm_path, "/usr/local/rvm"
```

Then there is a Capistrano extension that takes care of running `bundle` with the right options on the target host:

```ruby
require "bundler/capistrano"
```

This saves us from creating our own steps to run `bundle install` etc.

To be continued.
