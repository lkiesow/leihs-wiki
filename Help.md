## leihs 2.x documentation

We have prepared an administration and installation guide for leihs:

 * '''leihs 2.9:''' Administration Guide [(text format)](http://github.com/psy-q/leihs/raw/master/doc/admin_guide.txt) [(HTML format)](http://github.com/psy-q/leihs/raw/master/doc/admin_guide.html) [(PDF format)](http://github.com/psy-q/leihs/raw/master/doc/admin_guide.pdf)

There is no user guide yet! If you would like to volunteer to write a user guide, we would be happy to accept your work. Please contact Ramon (see [[DevPeople]]) if you want to contribute.

We have some Rdoc documentation so you see the class structure:
