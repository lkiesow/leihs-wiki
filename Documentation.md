# Scenarios specification

Our scenarios are specified within the`.feature` files and written in a human-readable syntax (Gherkin). They are always up-to-date as they are simultaneously integrated and used as tests in our continuous integration setup. You can read them [here](https://relishapp.com/leihs/).

# Technical documentation

Is to be found within our [documentation submodule](https://github.com/leihs/leihs_documentation/tree/master).
